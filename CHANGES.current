2024-02-01: olly
	    [Python] #2786 Fix handling of "default" typemap applied to method which

2024-01-31: olly
	    Fix assertion failure and segfault trying to use %constant to
	    deduce the type of a "float _Complex" constant.

2024-01-31: jim-easterbrook
            #2771 [Python] builtin fixes to handle NULL values passed to slots using
            functype: ssizeobjargproc and ternaryfunc.

2024-01-31: olly
	    [java] #2766 Fix segfault trying to wrap a constant whose type is unknown
	    to SWIG with "%javaconst(1);" enabled.

2024-01-31: wsfulton
            #2768 Fix seg fault handling upcasting when using %shared_ptr on some
            templates.

2024-01-31: olly
	    #2783 Fix incorrectly deduced type for function call.  Regression
	    introduced in 4.2.0.

2024-01-27: wsfulton
            [Python] Fix compilation error when wrapping two or more classes that
            have the same friend operator overload when the classes are in a namespace.

            https://sourceforge.net/p/swig/bugs/960/
            https://sourceforge.net/p/swig/bugs/807/
            Fix so that friend operators within a namespace can be correctly ignored
            or renamed.

2024-01-15: wsfulton
            Wrap friend functions that are defined or declared within a namespace.
            Previously unqualified friend definitions/declarations in a namespace were
            ignored.

            The visibility of unqualified friend functions in C++ is somewhat quirky
            and the documentation has been enhanced to aid wrapping of friends.

2024-01-12: wsfulton
            #2749 Fix seg fault handling friend constructor/destructor declarations.

2024-01-12: olly
	    [Ruby,Tcl] #2751 Fix -external-runtime output to define
	    SWIG_snprintf (bug introduced in 4.2.0).

2024-01-12: olly
	    Improve preprocessor warning for use of an undefined function-like
	    macro. SWIG now warns:

	    Warning 202: Could not evaluate expression 'MY_VERSION_AT_LEAST(1,2,3)'
	    Warning 202: Use of undefined function-like macro

	    instead of:

	    Warning 202: Could not evaluate expression 'MY_VERSION_AT_LEAST(1,2,3)'
	    Warning 202: Syntax error: expected operator

2024-01-11: PaulObermeier
	    [Tcl] Improve support for Tcl 9.0.  All examples and tests now pass
	    with Tcl 9.0.b1.

2024-01-06: wsfulton
            [Python] #2744 Regression fix - add in missing SwigPyIterator_T fragment for
            SwigPyIteratorClosed_T when using %import on an instantiated std::map.
